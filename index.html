	<p>Hello my name is Bich Nguyen, but everyone calls me Tina Nguyen. It is much easier to pronounce and no awkward pause, when people are trying to figure out how to pronounce it properly. I don't know how I got the name Tina from. My mom just told me that I went to school and came home as Tina. I was born in Hawaii and move to Florida when I was a child.I had been looking for a new career change. As a result, I have just started coding recently.I have enjoy seeing what I am able to do with just a glimps into the world of coding and I hope you enjoy it as well.</p>
